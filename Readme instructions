Step 1: Install Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager)

If you haven't already, download and install Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/). npm comes bundled with Node.js.

Step 2: Create a New React Project

npx create-react-app my-react-project

Step 3: Navigate to the Project Directory

Change into the newly created project directory:


cd my-react-project


Step 4: Create a Components Folder

Inside the `src` directory of your project, create a new folder named `components`:


mkdir src/components


Step 5: Inside the `src/components` directory, create a new file named `BookDetailsPage.js`


Step 6: Inside the `src/components` directory, create a new file named `BooksPage.js


Step 7: Start the Development Server

Run the following command to start the development server and open your new React project in the default web browser:


npm start
